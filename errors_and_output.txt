2023-09-21 16:26:59.960329: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:182] This TensorFlow binary is optimized to use available CPU instructions in performance-critical operations.
To enable the following instructions: SSE SSE2 SSE3 SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2 FMA, in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
All PyTorch model weights were used when initializing TFT5ForConditionalGeneration.

All the weights of TFT5ForConditionalGeneration were initialized from the PyTorch model.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use TFT5ForConditionalGeneration for predictions without further training.
